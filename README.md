Let's add a new feature: filtering out guests who have yet to respond. 

This will enable our users to see the current guest list at a glance. 

Unlike the previous features we've implemented, we'll add this one to the page dynamically. 

In other words, we'll create and insert all the new elements we need to the DOM. 

Then we'll attach behavior to those elements, all with JavaScript.
